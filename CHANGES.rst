 - Issue #5: Implemented `path.tempdir`, which returns a path object which is
   a temporary directory and context manager for cleaning up the directory.
 - Issue #12: One can now construct path objects from a list of strings by
   simply using path.joinpath. For example::

     path.joinpath('a', 'b', 'c') # or
     path.joinpath(*path_elements)

 - Issue #7: Add the ability to do chaining of operations that formerly only
   returned None.
 - Issue #4: Raise a TypeError when constructed from None.
